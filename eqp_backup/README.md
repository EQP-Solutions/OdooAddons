## Overview

necessary dependencies.

successfully, as they provide essential functionalities that the module depends on.

### Installation of Dependencies

   This is where the `requirements.txt` file is stored.

   You can navigate to the module folder using the terminal/command prompt:

2. **Install the required packages**: Once you are in the correct directory, use the following command to install all
   the necessary packages from the requirements.txt file:

    ```

This command will read the requirements.txt file and automatically install all the packages listed in it, along with any
of their dependencies.
